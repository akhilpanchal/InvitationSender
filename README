# Invitation Sender:

A simple command line tool that accepts a JSON records file consisting of the following information:
- Customer Name

Based on this information, and the location coordinates of the event venue and a radius distance,
the tool generates a list of customers who are within the given distance of the event venue and
sends them an invitation for the event.
